WHAT IS PONG JS
===============

Do you remember Pong? I'm sure you do. This is a basic multiplayer version of Pong written in Node.JS.
This is hardly a perfect version of the original game, more an experiment. I had fun coding it and I hope you'll have fun playing it.
Also I haven't got the time to test it with more than 4/5 people, so if you do let me know how it works.



REQUIREMENTS
============

Node.JS (http://nodejs.org/)
Express (http://expressjs.com/)
Socket.IO (http://socket.io/)

A web server
A browser with websockets support (see this for reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1253683/websocket-for-html5) 



HOW TO USE PONG.JS
==================

1. Put the Pong.JS folder anywhere on your web server
2. Open conf.js and set your server ip and the port you want to use for your express server
3. Execute server.js with node
4. Go to your Pong.JS page
5. Enjoy!

PS: while it's possible to play alone, it's better if you manage to get others to play with you :)



HOW DOES IT WORK
================

. When anyone join the game he'll be placed on the side with less players, (if the players are even, the new player will be placed on the left side)
. Every 5 bounces the speed of the ball increase. When a side score a point the speed reset to its default value
. You are the green racket, try not to get the ball behind you ... well, it's pong after all :)
